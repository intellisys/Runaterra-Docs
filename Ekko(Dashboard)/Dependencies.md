## [Axios](https://alligator.io/vuejs/rest-api-axios/) - (Cosuming api's)

Axios is a great http client library. It uses promises by default and runs on both the client and the server (which makes it appropriate for fetching data during server-side rendering). Itâ€™s also quite easy to use with Vue. Because it uses promises, you can combine it with async/await to get an amazingly concise and easy-to-use API.
